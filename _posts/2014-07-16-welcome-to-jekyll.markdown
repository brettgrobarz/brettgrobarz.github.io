I hope I can keep up with this, because life is moving super fast here in Austin, Texas. 

I created this site so that I could share what life is like down here in Texas with all of my family members at home. Everyone seems to have a different view of Texas, and most of my relatives have never been here.

So, I am going to use this blog to write blurbs to keep everyone updated on my life, as well as a live feed of photos from my instagram for the less tech-savvy ones (not everyone is as cool as my Mom with her instagram account).

So excuse the typos, and enjoy a glimpse into my life down here in Austin!
